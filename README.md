note:
If you encounter a file XXX. PS1 that cannot be loaded, 
because scripting is always prohibited on this system. 
Because the Windows default Restricted policy does not allow any scripts to be executed. 
the way to change it you can google yourself! 
Anyone who can find something on GitHub doesn't be a rookie.
